# A BRAG Guide To HPC

This repo provides a quick reference guide on how to access and use the HPC facilities at QUT. Example scripts are supplied to install relevent packages, and demonstrate how to submit jobs to HPC.

## NOTES: Guide is undergoing big updates
I am updating everything at the moment to include new info from the CDC Code Talk.
Should all be updated in about a week (21/04/21) :)

Can pull the Guide now, but is from an earlier state and a few things won't work properly. Just make sure you come back in a weeks time :)
